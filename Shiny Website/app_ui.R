         I used a scatterplot to show this correlation, however from the
         results it demostrates there is a small correlation between the two.
         However, the results disprove our hypothesis that the more
         amount of abortion clinics the more about of abortion rates. The
         graph displays (with one outlier) that the more abortion clinics
         the less total abortion rates in that region. This implies that
         less people need abortions in regions that have more abortion
         clinics available. This could be due to the fact that abortion
         clinics also provide other health care resources such as
         contraceptive, family planning, Plan B, health education and more,
         which can decrease the need for an unwanted pregnancy
         and therefore lessens the need for an abortion. "

                throughout the four different regions of the United States we
                found that the West had the most recorded number of
                clinics - 277 clinics - and the least being the Midwest - 91
                clinics. We can see that the West had over three times the
                number of abortion clinics compared to Midwest. This could
                imply that there's a lower need for demand in the Midwest than
                in the other regions, hence the lower number of clinics.
                Higher population regions such as the West and Northeast
                may have more clinics to serve more people. Beliefs and feeling
                towards abortion in specific regions may also be a large
                contributor to the significant difference in how many clinics
                that are opened."

                West had the most number of abortion clinics, it had the 2nd
                lowest abortion rate. However the South, which had the 2nd
                least number of clinics, surprisingly had the highest recorded
                abortion rates. Meanwhile the Midwest had the lowest number

                the same falling within the bracket of 71.86% - 68.68 %. This
                is very interesting to observe as that tells us the rate of
