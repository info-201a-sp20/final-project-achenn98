## Domain of Interest: Reproductive Health
**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

As a group, we believe that women should have reproductive rights. We think this would serve as an opportunity to delve into learning which reproductive resources are provided in the United States and the differences between in each state. We also find it interesting how there are many different sub-categories that fall under reproductive health such as teen health, resources, infant health, abortion, etc.

**Examples of data-drive projects related to this Domain**

1. https://lozierinstitute.org/health-clinics-nationwide-compared-to-planned-parenthood-centers/

This project focuses on federally-funded health clinics that serve low-income, minority populations in the United States in comparison to the number of Planned Parenthood centers. It showcases data by each state, providing the numbers and location of each Planned Parenthood and health clinics.

2. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/ss/ss6811a1.htm

This project focuses on the statistics of abortion surveillance, documenting the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal abortions through the United States. It contains many tables, charts, charts, and graphs to display their statistics and text to summarize their findings.

This is a planned parenthood project that showcases a survey they studied showcasing their participants' support of sexual education. They used a sample of 1,001 respondents over the age of 18 with an overwhelming majority supporting and encouraging free sexual education in school with charts and graphs to display their results.

**Data-driven questions we hope to answer**

1. Does the political party or religious affiliation affect the reproductive health resources in each state/region?

We can answer this by looking at the different political parties in each state/region and the amount of reproductive health resources available in that state/region and see if there is a correlation between those two data points. We can display this data by creating a graph of each state and displaying the majority political party represented by each party color and then using a location pin to represent the current health clinics. This will showcase the political party and the number of health clinics in each state.

2. Which states provide the most amount of reproductive resources? The least?

We can answer this by comparing how many resources each state provides and comparing them to one another. We can display this by creating a table by each state and using columns to represent different questions, such as how much total funding does the state provide (private/public), how many health clinic locations, services allowed, etc.

3. How has the amount of resources changed over time? (Make observations on the political climate/economy during these times.)

We can answer this by comparing the amount of resources the country or each state has at multiple points in time. We can answer this question by creating a graph that changes over time to display the opening and closing of locations with bigger location pins over clinics with more resources. This will potentially fluctuate over time.

## Finding Data

**Dataset #1: State Political Parties**

Webpage: https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/state-political-parties/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D

The dataset contains information about governor, state senate majority, state house majority, state attorney general, and state insurance commissioner political affiliations of each state in the United States.

Data was collected from multiple sources: National Governors Association (NGA), National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), and National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All the data were collected in 2019. The dataset is collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation (kff.org) that focuses on major healthcare issues facing the nation.

There are 50 rows and 6 columns including the states in the first row. Note that there are descriptions at the top and bottom of the .csv file.
This dataset can partially answer the question of how the political party affects reproductive health resources. Another dataset on reproductive health resources would need to be combined to fully answer the question.

**Dataset #2: Number of Abortion/Family Planning Clinics and Contraception Use**

The data is about womenâ€™s reproductive health on the state level, more specifically the number of abortion clinics and family planning clinics and the percentage of need met by said clinics. It also covers the percentage of women aged 18-49 who use contraceptives by state.

Data was collected from the Guttmacher Institute. Collected in multiple ways, the percentage of women using contraceptives was found by calling women and men over the age of 18 and having them self report, all data on abortion clinics were collected directly contacting over 2000 different clinics and conducted a census to find all abortion clinics over the country taking place from January 2018 to March 2019. The number of family planning clinics was collected through the US census (2010) and the percentage of need that those met was collected through combining the US census (2010), American Community Survey (2014-2016), and the Nation Survey of Family Growth (2011-2015).

There are 51 rows and 6 columns. This data set will start to answer what state provides the most amount of reproductive resources.

**Dataset #3  Anti-Reproductive Rights Crimes**

Webpage: https://data-openjustice.doj.ca.gov/sites/default/files/dataset/2019-06/ARRC_2004-2018.csv
https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/data

The data was collected by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Criminal Justice Statistics Center (CJSC) which collects information on Anti- Reproductive rights crimes. The data is collected from various Law Enforcement Entities (LEA) each month state-wide.

There are a total of 21 columns and 106 rows/entries. The dataset will help us to answer if there is less support amongst states with higher conservative and religious backgrounds. This can be seen through certain states who are more against reproductive rights and in turn, more crimes occur in those locations. This data set will help us to view data on the crimes that are committed against reproductive health services providers, clients, assistants or the facilities. It goes into depth on where these services are provided if religion is involved, location of the crime, type of victim, race/ethnicity, gender of victims and suspects, weapon involved, and property loss or damage.
